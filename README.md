# Fire Alert System - Autonomous Drone Navigation for Wildfire Detection

## Overview

The Fire Alert System is an autonomous UAV-based solution designed to monitor large forest areas for early wildfire detection. The system employs advanced drone technology with sophisticated navigation capabilities to operate in challenging environments characterized by heat, smoke, and complex terrain.

## Project Description

This conceptual design addresses the growing threat of wildfires, which are becoming increasingly frequent and severe due to climate change and human activities. The system uses unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multiple sensors to:

- **Monitor** vast forest regions in real-time
- **Detect** fires at early stages
- **Navigate** autonomously through challenging environments
- **Report** precise fire locations to ground response teams
- **Assist** in fire suppression efforts

## Key Features

### Navigation System
- **Hybrid Navigation Approach**: Combines three complementary methods:
  - Map-based navigation using pre-existing spatial data
  - Real-time obstacle detection and avoidance
  - Dynamic path planning and route optimization

### Sensor Integration
- **LiDAR sensors** for accurate distance measurement and terrain mapping
- **Thermal cameras** for heat detection and fire identification
- **Computer vision systems** for obstacle recognition
- **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)** for orientation and movement tracking
- **GPS systems** for global positioning (where available)

### Environmental Adaptability
- Heat and smoke resistance
- Dense vegetation navigation
- Uneven terrain handling
- Real-time path adjustment capabilities

## Technical Architecture

### Navigation Components

#### 1. Map-Based Navigation System
- **Map-dependent**: Uses pre-existing 3D environmental models
- **Map-building**: Creates real-time maps during navigation
- **Map-independent**: Employs optical flow techniques for motion estimation

#### 2. Obstacle Detection and Avoidance
- **Optical flow methods**: Single camera image analysis using Lucas-Kanade algorithms
- **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: Real-time environment mapping with ORB-SLAM libraries
- **Bionic vision algorithms**: Insect-inspired obstacle detection

#### 3. Path Planning Approach
- **Global path planning**: Initial route calculation using A-star and genetic algorithms
- **Local path planning**: Real-time path adjustment using sensor data
- **RRT (Rapidly Exploring Random Tree)**: Collision-free path generation

## System Requirements

### Hardware Specifications
- UAV platform capable of carrying multiple sensors
- High-performance onboard computing unit
- Long-range communication systems
- Weather-resistant sensor housing

### Software Dependencies
- Computer vision libraries (OpenCV, ORB-SLAM)
- Path planning algorithms (A-star, RRT)
- Sensor fusion frameworks
- Real-time communication protocols

## Advantages

- **Enhanced Safety**: Multi-layered obstacle avoidance prevents collisions
- **Reliability**: Hybrid approach compensates for individual method limitations
- **Adaptability**: Real-time environment response and path adjustment
- **Efficiency**: Optimized route planning reduces flight time and energy consumption
- **Precision**: Accurate fire location reporting for rapid response

## Applications
